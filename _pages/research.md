## Open Questions
My research includes a broad range of topics in stellar astrophysics. In particular, I focus on understanding how the interactions between radiation and gas impact the lives and deaths of massive stars. Using numerical simulations and analytical calculations, I strive to answer open questions like:
- How do stellar feedback processes regular star formation in massive star clusters?
- Is the stellar density in the cores of massive star clusters high enough to
