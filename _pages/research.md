## Research Interests 
My research includes a broad range of topics in stellar astrophysics. They can be roughly grouped into three subjects:
- Modeling the effects of radiation-matter coupling in super-Eddington systems;
- Predicting the observational signatures using radiation transfer techniques;
- Developing and applying deep learning models to analyze astronomical data. 

Using analytical and numerical methods, I focus primarily on the study of how radiation impacts the lives and deaths of massive stars. I strive to understand the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of radiation-dominated stellar systems and to provide insights on how to interpret their observations. My research projects also necessitate continuous improvements of the numerical methods in radiation transport and hydrodynamics, which I also devote a portion of my time on.
In the following, you will find links to a few ongoing/side projects that I am working on.
