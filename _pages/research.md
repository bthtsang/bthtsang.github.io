## Research Interests 
My research includes a broad range of topics in stellar astrophysics. Using analytical and numerical methods, I focus primarily on the study of how radiation impacts the lives and deaths of massive stars. I strive to understand the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of radiation-dominated stellar systems and to provide insights on how to interpret observations. My research projects also necessitate the development of advanced numerical methods in radiation transport and hydrodynamics. In face of the rapidly growing volume of time-domain astronomical data (think [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) and [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)), I am actively exploring the applications of artificial neural networks in automating our analysis pipelines. 

In the following, I will briefly summarize the main topics I spend the majority of my work hours on.

### Massive Star Clusters

**Why they matter:**
Massive star clusters hold the keys to many intriguing open questions in astronomy. Their birthplaces are believed to be the most active star formation regions in the history of the universe. Massive clusters that formed at high redshifts may survive to be the globular clusters we see today. The intense stellar radiation fields and supernova explosions from the massive stars can impact galaxy evolution. The close proximity of stars in the cluster cores is conducive to forming compact object mergers that could give rise to gravitational wave signals.  

### Simulating Strong Radiation-Matter Coupling

**Why it matters:**
During the formation and the explosive deaths of massive stars, the strong coupling between radiation and gas can significantly affect the dynamics and the observable signatures of the systems. Most of these interactions cannot be directly observed. Therefore, accurately modeling them can help us to develop an understanding of the key physics that controls the systems.

### Machine Learning Applications

**Why it matters**
With the advent of the next-generation surveys such as the Rubin Observatory, automatic pipelines capable of processing an unprecedented amount of time-domain astronomical data are required. To put it in perspective, these surveys will provide light curves from billion of stars; manual processing of such vast amount of data is simply impractical. In recent years we have also witnessed the rapid expansion in the applications of artificial neural networks in science and engineering.
