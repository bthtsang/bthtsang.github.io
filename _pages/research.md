## You can find my full publication list at [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/libraries/tbxiKajfTsSjDC7Ir7sZxA), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nGVc2BAAAAAJ&hl=en), or [ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6543-2993).

## Research Interests 
My research involves a broad range of topics in computational astrophysics. They can roughly be grouped into:
- Enhance the efficiency and accuracy of radiation/light transport and fluid dynamics simulations on heterogeneous computing platforms;
- Develop and deploy deep learning techniques to streamline our radiation/light transport and data analysis workflows;
- Study the effects of strong radiation-matter coupling in stellar systems.

In the following, you will find links to a few ongoing/side projects that I am working on.

## Ongoing Work
