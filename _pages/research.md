## Research Interests 
My research includes a broad range of topics in stellar astrophysics. Using analytical and numerical methods, I focus primarily on the study of how radiation impacts the lives and deaths of massive stars. I strive to understand the physical mechanisms governing the dynamics of radiation-dominated stellar systems and to provide insights on how to interpret observations. My research projects also necessitate the development of advanced numerical methods in radiation transport and hydrodynamics. In face of the rapidly growing volume of time-domain astronomical data (think [Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) and [Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)](https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/)), I am actively exploring the applications of neural networks in automating our analysis pipelines. 

In the following, I will briefly summarize the main topics I spend the majority of my work hours on.

### Massive Star Clusters

This is my favorite image taken by the *Hubble Space Telescope*, showing the R136 star cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud.
- How do stellar feedback processes regular star formation in massive star clusters?
- Is the stellar density in the cores of massive star clusters high enough to 


### Radiation Hydrodynamics


### Machine Learning

### Software Instruments
I use a collection of software instruments in my research. The main tools are
