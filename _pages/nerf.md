**Why this matters:**
[Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934) is a new class of deep learning framework for novel view synthesis. Given a number of images with known camera positions/angles, the goal is to render a scene from unobserved viewpoints. Realistic and efficient rendering of 3D scenes is essential for real-time and interactive data visualization and exploration.

**How we modeled this:**
