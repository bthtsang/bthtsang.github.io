As an astrophysicist, I see the beauty of the universe in its underlying form, in mathematical terms and equations. Being able to sharing such beauty with people around me is a privilege and part of why I do what I do.

# Public Talks & Guest Lectures
Besides research and mentoring, I am also engaged in sharing my research in public talks and lectures. Below are some of the events I have participated.

# Astrobites
![astrobites logo](/files/astrobites-logo-1.png)
[astrobites.org](https://astrobites.org/) is an astronomy outreach blog maintained by graduate students all around the globe. The site publishes daily summaries of the latest research papers in astronomy.
I was an author of the site from 2015 - 2017 ([my articles](https://astrobites.org/author/btsang/)); since then I have transitioned to contribute as one of the site administrators.
