Hello!

I am a computational astrophysicist at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on using multi-dimensional, multi-physics computer simulations to study the life and death of massive stars.
Throughout the lives of these giants, blasts of intense light not only are capable of disrupting the dusty gas clouds nearby, their traversal through interstellar space also encode valuable physics about the stars and the environments they reside in.
The main part of my work is devoted to developing, advancing, and deploying numerical radiation transport and machine learning technologies used in the production and analysis of astrophysical simulations.

Before Berkeley, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/) (2018 - 2020). I received my Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Texas at Austin, studying the formation of massive stars. 

My astrophysics and machine learning publications are available at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nGVc2BAAAAAJ&hl=en).
