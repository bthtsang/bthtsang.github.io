Hello!

I am a computational astrophysicist at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on using multi-dimensional, multi-physics computer simulations to study the life and death of massive stars (stars about 8 times or more than the mass of the Sun). Throughout the lives of these giants, blasts of intense light not only are capable of disrupting the dusty gas clouds nearby, their traversal through interstellar space also encode valuable physics about the stars and the environments/scenes they reside in.
Therefore, a big part of my work is devoted to improving the speed and accuracy of numerical methods used in radiation/light transport and computational fluid dynamics simulations.

Recently, I have also become a machine learning practitioner. My goal is to leverage the active development in deep learning to advance our light transport and data analysis workflows.

Before Berkeley, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/) (2018 - 2020). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin, studying the formation of massive stars.
