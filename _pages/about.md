Hello!

I am a computational astrophysicist at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on using multi-dimensional, multi-physics computer simulations to study the life and death of massive stars. The nature of these giant stars depends on the complex interplay of many physical processes: fluid dynamics, gravity, turbulence, radiation and magnetic fields, and nuclear burning. A major part of my work is devoted to designing, implementing, and advancing software systems underlying the production and analysis of astrophysics simulations.

Before Berkeley, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara (2018 - 2020). I received my Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Texas at Austin, studying the formation of massive stars. 

My astrophysics and machine learning publications are available at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nGVc2BAAAAAJ&hl=en).
