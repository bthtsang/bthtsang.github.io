Hello!

I am a computational astrophysicist at UC Berkeley. My research focuses on using computer simulations to model the most momentous stages of massive stars' lives: their births and deaths. I am particularly interested in understanding how radiation drives the life-and-death dynamical evolution and how its interactions with gas imprint the observed signatures. My work often requires numerical schemes that are fast and accurate. So I also devote some work hours in advancing numerical techniques in radiation transport and hydrodynamical calculations. Recently, I have also become a machine learning practitioner. My goal is to leverage the active development in deep learning to fulfill the increasing demands for efficient processing of the ever-growing amount of astronomical data.

Since September 2020, I have been a postdoctoral scholar at the [Theoretical Astrophysics Center, UC Berkeley](https://tac.berkeley.edu/). Before Berkeley, I was a postdoctoral scholar at the [Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics, UC Santa Barbara](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/) (2018 - 2020). I received my Ph.D. from the University of Texas at Austin working with Milos Milosavljevic. Before that, I did a B.S. in Mathematics and Physics and an M.Phil. in Physics at the University of Hong Kong.
