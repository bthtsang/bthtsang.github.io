## Mentoring
I am currently mentoring two undergraduate students on machine learning research in astronomy. 

- Siddhant Solanki (UC Santa Barbara) and I are exploring the application of data augmentation to improve light curve classification of imbalance datasets. Siddhant is applying for grad school in astronomy this semester, look out for his application!
- Abhay Agarwal (UC Berkeley) and I are applying convolutional neural networks to analyze the statistics of isothermal turbulent gas clouds.


## Teaching
I enjoy teaching and sharing the latest news in astronomy with my students. During grad school, I was a teaching assistant in all 12 semesters in 6 different undergraduate courses. They span from first-year introductory astronomy, to advanced courses in stellar astrophysics and star/planet formation.
